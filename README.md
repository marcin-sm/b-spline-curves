# B-spline Curves
Visualization of the Bohem's algorithm for creating third-degree B-spline curves in 3D

## Instruction
To use the visualization, only a mouse is needed.

### Instruction construction mode inside the cube: 
* Pressing LMB generates a random point inside the cube.
* Pressing PPM enters the interaction mode.
### Interaction mode: 
* Pressing LMB deletes existing points and switches to mode I.
